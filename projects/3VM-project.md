**Project:** A personal-finance web application deployed across **three virtual machines**.

**Stack:**
- **db-vm**: PostgreSQL database storing transactions & budgets  
- **api-vm**: Node.js + Express REST API handling business logic  
- **web-vm**: Nginx web server hosting front-end + proxying API  

**What it does:**  
Users can record income/expenses, define/manage budgets, and view summaries by category and net balance. Everything is designed for modular deployment across separate VMs (ideal for cloud or on-premises setups).

**Why it matters:**  
Demonstrates full-stack architecture, virtualization & infrastructure design, and deployment best practices — relevant for cloud-computing roles and DevOps-aware engineering positions.
