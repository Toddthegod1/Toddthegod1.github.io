Hey I’m **Todd Klinger**, a CS & Data Analytics student at Dickinson College (Math minor), and I studied abroad for a semester at the **University of Otago** in Dunedin, New Zealand.

**What I do**
- Build practical data & cloud projects (AWS EC2/RDS/S3, Python, SQL, Java) or just anything to learn and have fun with it
- Design and document APIs (NIH **NBIA Advanced REST API** OpenAPI/Swagger work)
- Analyze and visualize data (R, Python/pandas/matplotlib)

**Projects I’m proud of**
- **Carbon Tracker** — Deployed on AWS (EC2 + RDS + Gunicorn); tracks carbon-output events with a clean UI and DB-backed analytics.
- **NIH NBIA API Spec** — Structured endpoints for cancer imaging research to make the API more discoverable and usable.
- **Goodreads Scraper** — Extracted book/ratings data; cleaned and analyzed it with R/Python to surface trends.

**Interests** 
- Playing Table Tennis, Tennis, Volleyball, Badminton and working out at the gym
- Casually watching sports (NFL, NBA, MLB)
- Learning by watching random Youtube videos with topics ranging from computer science to sports to philosophy to politics to economics
- Playing video games
- Travelling
- Hiking
